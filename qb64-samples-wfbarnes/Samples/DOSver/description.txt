 DOSVER.BAS
------------
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
The version of QBasic that comes with DOS 5 or later.

WHAT DOSVER.BAS DOES:
This program demonstrates how an assembly language routine can be used within 
a QBasic program to perform a task that QBasic does not perform very 
efficiently on its own.  This simple example program determines the DOS 
version under which it's running.  You can use the technique in your own 
QBasic programs where you want to determine the DOS version.  See EXIST.BAS on 
this diskette for another example of how assembly language can be incorporated 
into a QBasic program.

USING DOSVER.BAS:
To load the program in QBasic, type QBASIC DOSVER.BAS (using path names if 
necessary) at the DOS prompt. Then run the program by selecting the Start 
option in QBasic's Run menu, or press Shift-F5. The program clears the screen 
and prints a message listing the version of DOS running on your computer.

For further details on DOSVER.BAS, see "Supercharge Your QBasic Programs" (DRG 
#13, January 1994, page 57).
