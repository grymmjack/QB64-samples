 SETERR.BAS
------------
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The version of QBasic that comes with DOS 5 or later, 
Microsoft Quick Basic 4.x, or GW-Basic.

WHAT SETERR.BAS DOES:
This program, which was originally written in GW-Basic, creates a short 
program called SETERR.COM that lets you set DOS's ERRORLEVEL variable to any 
value from zero to 255. It also displays the ASCII character corresponding to 
the value entered. Batch files often use ERRORLEVEL values to make decisions 
based on the presence of certain conditions.

USING SETERR.BAS:
To load the program, type QBASIC SETERR.BAS (using path names if necessary) at 
the DOS prompt. (Type BASIC SETERR if you're using GW-Basic.) Then run the 
program by selecting the Start option in QBasic's Run menu, or press Shift-F5. 
(In the GW-Basic environment, type in and enter RUN, or press F2.)

The program will create a file called SETERR.COM. You can then set the 
ERRORLEVEL value by typing SETERR followed by a whole number between zero 
and 255--for example:

SETERR 100
