SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
The version of QBasic that comes with DOS 5 or later, or Microsoft Quick Basic

WHAT QBCLOCK.BAS DOES:
This QBasic program displays a large analog clock in the middle of your

accurate time until you press any key to stop the clock.

at the DOS prompt. Then, run the program by selecting the Start option in 
QBasic's Run menu, or press Shift-F5. To stop the clock, press any key.

For further details on QBCLOCK.BAS, as well as hints for modifying the
