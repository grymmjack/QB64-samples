Taito's Space Invaders


    ##     The Invaders march ...
   ####      Bom bom bom bom ...
  ######       Left, right, fire!
 ## ## ##        Faster, faster they march ...
 ########          Suddenly you're 11 again!
   #  #              Dodge the bombs ...
  # ## #               They're turning green ...
 # #  # #                Get them before they land!
