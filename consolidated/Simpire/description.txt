' A strategy-type game in QuickBasic.
'
' You may will out of string space or memory in Qbasic 1.1,
' but this does work in Quickbasic 4.5. I would compile it, but
' it gets alot of errors...
'
' Some of the unfinished features in the beta are that
' you cannot battle another city, you cannot load a custom
' map yet, and sound has not been added. Also, the gold mine
' needs it's options programmed. You must go down to the CHDIR
' command and change it to the directory the program is in.
' I also need to make the small map update it's self.
'
' To gain citizens, build houses and Townhalls. To gain gold,
' you cut down trees and trade them for gold or by assassinating
' another city leader. To get more soldiers, you trade gold
' for them. Use the arror keys to scroll, and S to select menu
' items.
