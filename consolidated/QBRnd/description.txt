Many QBasic programs, especially games, involve generating random numbers.   
This program handles a variety of random number tasks, and you may want  
incorporate its techniques and subroutines in your own programs. 
 
QBRND.BAS is capable of generating random lotto numbers, generating a  
tournament draw, determining a draft order at random, choosing bingo numbers,  
and more. 
 
To run the program from the DOS command line, change to the directory  
containing QBRND.BAS, then type: 
 
QBASIC /RUN QBRND 
 
 
Instead of limiting the number choices to a range, such as 1 to 100, the  
program asks for the size of the sample and then asks how many times you wish  
to draw from that sample. For a lottery, for instance, you might enter 49 as  
the sample size and 6 as the number of draws; for bingo, good values might be  
75 and 75.
