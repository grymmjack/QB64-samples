---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The game may be a little slow on PCs < 486, I can't try it, I've got just a
486/100/12. Please mail me the bugs you find (Except that Snoopy sometimes
eats the earth. I've seen it already.)
If it's TOO slow, disable the "playbg"command.
