Q: What is Joki?
A: Joki does joystick-keyboard emulation on the BIOS level, enabling you to
play some 'keyboard only' games (usually those written in BASIC), with
your joystick. Joki works for the 1986 version of SOPWITH and improves
joystick performance in PARATROOPER. Actually, there are lots of older
games out there that are Joki compatible.

Q: Where is Joki's new feature?
A: Internally, Joki 2.1 is faster than version 2.0

Operating instructions
======================
To play the 1986 version of SOPWITH with your joystick, type the
following command:
JOKI >SOP.BAT
Joki prompts you for the keys for stick left, right, forward, backward
and Button 1 and 2. Note that versions of SOPWITH from BMB Compuscience
after 1986 aren't Joki compatible.

The next list of keys works nicely:
Stick left:     ',' (comma)     = nose up
Stick right:    '/' (slash)     = nose down
Stick forward:  'x'             = increase rpm
Stick backward: '\' (backslash) = decrease rpm
Button 1:       ' ' (space)     = fire
Button 2:       'b'             = bomb

Joki saves the keys to the SOP.BAT hI-score program (using DOS
redirection). Next time you want to play SOPWITH, just type SOP to
program your joystick.

For QBASIC NIBBLES.BAS shipped with some versions of DOS, you'll program
your joystick with the arrow keys, and press Space and 'y' for the
buttons.

Keep in mind that some games, like SOPWITH, respond only to lowercase or
uppercase letters, so you must set Caps Lock and Num Lock accordingly
before creating a hI-score program.

If a game has less than six controls, you can press any irrelevant keys
for the unused joystick states. You can edit a hI-score program and
change values to zero to disable those functions. Example:
JOKI 0 0 0 0 0 0
disables all functions.

To remove Joki from memory, you have to reset your computer.
Alternatively, you can run Joki from a DOS session under Windows.

If you toggle your computer's turbo after Joki is loaded, you'll have to
re-center your joystick by pressing Ctrl-Button 1, i.e., hold down the
Control key on the keyboard, then press Button 1 which is usually the
joystick's trigger. Your game will pause until you release the Ctrl
key.

Here are some other settings that can be adjusted on-the-fly:
Switch off/on       Ctrl-Button 2
Repeat rate         Left Shift-Button 1 (FFFast, Slow, Standard)
Analog sensitivity  Left Shift-Button 2 (changes the dead zone)

Joki defaults to Standard repeat rate and High Analog sensitivity.

Note: In general, the default settings work fine. The FFFast repeat rate
can overwhelm some games, like SOPWITH, causing it to freeze.

When you run a hI-score program, Joki displays its current settings.

Programmer's Guide
==================
Joki works for games that poll the keyboard for input, for example:
...
150 A$ = INKEY$ :REM A$ = INKEY$
160 IF A$ <> "" THEN GOSUB 2000 :REM GOSUB 2000 IF A$ <> ""
...
If a game continues to read keys while there are keys waiting, the game
will freeze 'til the cows come home if Joki's FFFast repeat rate is
selected.

Congratulations, you're now an official Joki gamer.
