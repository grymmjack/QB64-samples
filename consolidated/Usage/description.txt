-----------
 USAGE.BAS
-----------
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
The version of QBasic that comes with DOS 5 or later, or Microsoft Quick Basic 
4.x.

WHAT USAGE.BAS DOES:
USAGE.BAS is a simple program that can help you detect when someone has been 
using your computer in your absence.  It creates a file that records the date 
and time whenever your computer is powered up or rebooted.

USING USAGE.BAS:
Copy USAGE.BAS into your C:\DOS directory.  Then add the following line to 
your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

QBASIC /RUN C:\DOS\USAGE.BAS

Now, each time your computer is turned on or rebooted, the QBasic screen will 
flash briefly and USAGE.BAS will run, recording the date and time in a file 
named UL.SYS, which is located in the C:\DOS directory.  Later, you can 
examine the contents of UL.SYS by changing to the C:\DOS directory and typing:

TYPE UL.SYS

at the DOS prompt.  You'll be able to see exactly when your computer was 
started up.  The dates and times listed may help you determine if someone is 
using your computer when you are not around.
