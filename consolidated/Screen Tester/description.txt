' This program looks big, but it is actually quite small. Run it through a
' decommenter to see how small it is. Anyway, this program tests what screen
' modes your graphics adapter supports. You can find one included with the
' QuickBasic 4.5 examples, but this one is easier to manipulate and more
' effective. This lists all the screen modes your computer supports, instead
' of just a few. The REMs show the variables that can be manipulated.
' This program is free to distribute as long as these first 12 lines of
' comments are NOT removed and/or changed.
