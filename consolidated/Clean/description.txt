 CLEAN.BAS
-----------
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
The version of QBasic that comes with DOS 5 or later, or Microsoft Quick Basic 
4.x.

WHAT CLEAN.BAS DOES:
Use this program when you want to delete all files on your hard drive ending 
with a particular file extension, such as .BAK or .TMP.  You specify the 
extension, and CLEAN.BAS does the rest.  The program includes safeguards so 
you won't mistakenly delete .COM, .EXE, or .SYS files.

USING CLEAN.BAS:
To load the program, type QBASIC CLEAN.BAS (using path names if necessary) at 
the DOS prompt. Then run the program by selecting the Start option in QBasic's 
Run menu, or press Shift-F5. The screen will clear, and you will be prompted 
to enter the file extension of files you wish to delete.  For example, to 
delete all files with the .BAK extension, enter BAK and press Enter.  The 
program will search your hard drive for files with the .BAK extension, then 
display a list of files found and ask if you wish to delete them.  If you 
answer Y for Yes, the files on the list will be deleted.  If you answer N for 
No, none of the listed files will be deleted.

Pressing Enter when you are prompted for a file extension ends the program.  
If you enter COM, EXE, or SYS when prompted, the program beeps and asks for 
another extension, since under normal circumstances, you would never want to 
delete files with those extensions.
