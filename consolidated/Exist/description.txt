 EXIST.BAS
-----------
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
The version of QBasic that comes with DOS 5 or later.

WHAT EXIST.BAS DOES:
This program demonstrates how an assembly language routine can be used within 
a QBasic program to perform a task that QBasic does not perform very 
efficiently on its own.  This simple example program determines whether or not 
a particular file exists.  You can use the technique in your own QBasic 
programs.  See DOSVER.BAS on this diskette for another example of how assembly 
language can be incorporated into a QBasic program.

USING EXIST.BAS:
To load the program in QBasic, type QBASIC EXIST.BAS (using path names if 
necessary) at the DOS prompt. Then run the program by selecting the Start 
option in QBasic's Run menu, or press Shift-F5. The program then prompts you 
to enter the name of a file. After you do this, EXIST.BAS prints a message 
telling you whether or not the file exists in the current directory.
