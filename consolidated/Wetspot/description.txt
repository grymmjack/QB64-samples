' Well, this is my first game written in QBASIC.
' Sorry, but I haven't so much time to add comments to this source, but
' I think it's pretty simple to understand.
' The target of this game is to kill every monster in less than 90 seconds
' to gain next level. You control a little crab, and you must push bricks
' towards your enemies to kill them. If you push a brick and besides it
' there is another one, the block you pushed on will be destroyed, maybe
' dropping a bonus. Bonuses are various, and someone has a particular
' function (For example: Lightning will destroy every monster on the screen).
' Not all bricks can be moved. Each level has three special blocks, and when
' you put them together, you gain a special multiplier bonus (2x or 3x if
' you put together two or three blocks).
' Look out for monsters that follow you and good luck!!
'
' Controls are:
'
'        Player One              Player Two                 General
'         Left:  4                Left:  A                  Pause: P
'         Right: 6                Right: D                  Quit:  ESC
'         Up:    8                Up:    W
'         Down:  5                Down:  S
'         Fire:  \                Fire:  ENTER
'
' Since this is not the final version, it contains only 21 levels.
' Final version will contain:
'
' - 100 levels (I hope so...)
' - 8 different enemies
' - Sound Blaster music and sound effects
