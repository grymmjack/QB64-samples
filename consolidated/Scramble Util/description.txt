 SCRAMBLE.BAS
 DESCRAM.BAS

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The version of QBasic that comes with DOS 5 or later, 
Microsoft Quick Basic 4.x, or GW-Basic.

WHAT THE PROGRAMS DO:
SCRAMBLE.BAS scrambles the contents of text files so that are unreadable.  Use 
it to protect sensitive files from being read by others.  DESCRAM.BAS reverses 
the scrambling process and restores files to their original form.  For use 
ONLY with text files.  Do NOT use these programs with .COM, .EXE, or other 
kinds of binary files!  Loss of data could result!

USING SCRAMBLE.BAS AND DESCRAM.BAS:
To scramble a text file, load SCRAMBLE.BAS by typing QBASIC SCRAMBLE.BAS 
(using path names if necessary) at the DOS prompt. Then, run the program by 
selecting the Start option in QBasic's Run menu, or press Shift-F5. After the 
screen clears you will be prompted for the name of the text file you wish to 
scramble.  After you supply the name of the file to scramble, you will be 
asked to enter the name of the file to which the scramble data should be 
written.  This must be a file name different from the original file.  When you 
press Enter, SCRAMBLE.BAS will scramble the contents of the first file, write 
the scrambled data to the second file, then delete the original file.  If you 
display the scrambled file with DOS's TYPE command, it will appear to be full 
of meaningless symbols and characters.

To descramble the file, run DESCRAM.BAS.  You'll be prompted to enter the file 
name of the scrambled file, then the file name to which the unscrambled data 
should be written.  DESCRAM.BAS will descramble the file, create the 
unscrambled version, then delete the scrambled file.
