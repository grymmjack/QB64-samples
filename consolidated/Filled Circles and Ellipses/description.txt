We develop four variations on the CIRCLE command in the form of four SUBs:
(i) CircleFill = Filled circle
(ii) EllipseFill = Filled ellipse
(iii) EllipseTilt = Tilted ellipse
(iv) EllipseTiltFill = Tilted and filled ellipse

These works have been optimized for speed and respect for alpha transparency.
