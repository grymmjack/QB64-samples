'                                 SORTDEMO
' This program graphically demonstrates six common sorting algorithms.  It
' prints 25 or 43 horizontal bars, all of different lengths and all in random
' order, then sorts the bars from smallest to longest.
'
' The program also uses SOUND statements to generate different pitches,
' depending on the location of the bar being printed. Note that the SOUND
' statements delay the speed of each sorting algorithm so you can follow
' the progress of the sort.  Therefore, the times shown are for comparison
' only. They are not an accurate measure of sort speed.
'
' If you use these sorting routines in your own programs, you may notice
' a difference in their relative speeds (for example, the exchange
' sort may be faster than the shell sort) depending on the number of
' elements to be sorted and how "scrambled" they are to begin with.
