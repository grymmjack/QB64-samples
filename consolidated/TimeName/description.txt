 TIMENAME.BAS
 CFGBAK.BAT
--------------
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
The version of QBasic that comes with DOS 5 or later, or Microsoft Quick Basic 
4.x.

WHAT TIMENAME.BAS DOES:
TIMENAME.BAS is a utility program that creates unique file names based on the 
current date and time.  Use it with batch files that must automatically 
create new file names that aren't currently being used.  Using this program 
can prevent you from inadvertently copying a file over another file of the 
same name.  CFGBAK.BAT is an example showing how you might use TIMENAME.BAS 
in a batch file.

USING TIMENAME.BAS:
TIMENAME.BAS works by creating a batch file called SETNAME.BAT, which consists 
of two lines, which look like this:

@ECHO OFF
SET TIMENAME=3ML02317

The combination of numbers and letters at the end of the second line is the 
unique file name created by TIMENAME.BAS.  Each time you run TIMENAME.BAS, the 
file name it inserts into SETNAME.BAT will be different.  When SETNAME.BAT is 
run, it sets a DOS environment variable called TIMENAME equal to the unique 
file name.  This file name is then available for use in batch files, as 
illustrated in CFGBAK.BAT

CFGBAK.BAT shows how you might employ TIMENAME.BAS to create backup copies of 
files.  It creates backup versions of your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, 
storing them in a directory called C:\CFGBAK.  (If you use CFGBAK.BAT to 
experiment with TIMENAME.BAS, be sure to create the C:\CFGBAK directory before 
you begin.)  Because the backups have unique file names, they are reasonably 
safe from being inadvertently overwritten.

#14, March 1994, page 59).
