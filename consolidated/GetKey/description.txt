 SETKEYS.BAS
 GETKEY.BAS
-------------
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS: The version of QBasic that comes with DOS 5 or later, 
Microsoft Quick Basic 4.x, or GW-Basic.

WHAT THE PROGRAMS DO:
Used in combination, GETKEY.BAS and SETKEYS.BAS let you set the startup status 
of your computer's Num Lock, Caps Lock, and Scroll Lock keys in one operation. 
GETKEY.BAS displays a number that represents the current status of your 
keyboard. SETKEYS.BAS uses that number to set your keyboard status.

USING GETKEY.BAS AND SETKEYS.BAS
Set the Caps Lock, Num Lock, and other keys the way you want them to be at 
bootup. Load GETKEY.BAS by typing QBASIC GETKEY.BAS (using path names if 
necessary) at the DOS prompt. Then run the program by selecting the Start 
option in QBasic's Run menu, or press Shift-F5. Write down the keyboard status 
number displayed by the program. Then load SETKEYS.BAS and scroll to line 20 
of the listing. Substituting the status number for xxx. Save the modified 
program by choosing the File menu's Save option. Run SETKEYS.BAS using the 
procedure outlined above.

To run SETKEYS.BAS automatically when you boot the computer, add a line such 
as the following to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

QBASIC /RUN C:\DRGSL1\SETKEYS.BAS

(If you keep SETKEYS.BAS in a directory other than C:\DRGSL1, change the line 
above to refer to the directory where SETKEYS.BAS is actually stored.)

If you have a Basic compiler, such as Microsoft's Quick Basic, delete line 30 
and run the compiled SETKEYS.EXE file directly from AUTOEXEC.BAT.

Note: On most PC keyboards, the status indicator lights for the lock keys will 
change to reflect the settings made by running SETKEYS.BAS. The lights on some 
older keyboards, however, may be out of synch with the actual keyboard status.

For further information, see the "Key States" tip in DRG's Essential Guide to 
DOS Special Issue (October 1993, page 54).
