The purpose of PRINTSCR.BAS is to demonstrate a handy subroutine called  
PrintScreen that you may want to incorporate into your own programs.  When  
you call PrintScreen, it sends the contents of the current screen display to  
your printer. 
 
To run the program from the DOS command line, change to the directory  
containing PRINTSCR.BAS, then type: 
 
QBASIC /RUN PRINTSCR 
 
 
PRINTSCR.BAS first asks you to specify how many lines you wish to display and  
print. Either 25 or 43 lines can be entered, as they are the two most common  
number of lines displayable by most PCs.  The program then creates a sample  
screen display using the number of lines you entered, then calls the  
PrintScreen subroutine to print it. After printing, the subroutine sends a  
form feed command to eject the page from your printer. 
 
PrintScreen has some limitations.  First, it works only with text screens.  
Attempting to print graphics screen will yield unpredictable results.  
Secondly, PrintScreen assumes your screen displays 80 characters per line.  
The PrintScreen routine requires one parameter, NumLines%, to tell it how  
many lines to print. 
 
Add this capability to your own programs by typing the PrintScreen subroutine  
into your listings or by copying and pasting from PRINTSCR.BAS.  Then, any  
time you want to print the current screen, set NumLines% equal to the number  
of screen display lines you want to print, then insert a line like the  
following into your program: 
 
CALL PrintScreen(NumLines%)
