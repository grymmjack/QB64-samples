 SWAPPRNT.BAS
--------------
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
The version of QBasic that comes with DOS 5 or later, or Microsoft Quick Basic 
4.x.

WHAT SWAPPRNT.BAS DOES:
This program is for use on computers that have two printer ports, LPT1 and 
LPT2.  When you run SWAPPRNT.BAS, it swaps the two printer ports, so that 
information that would normally go to the printer attached to LPT1 now goes to 
LPT2, and vice versa.

USING SWAPPRNT.BAS:
To load the program, type QBASIC SWAPPRNT.BAS (using path names if necessary) 
at the DOS prompt. Then run the program by selecting the Start option in 
QBasic's Run menu, or press Shift-F5.  The program produces no visible output, 
but the printer ports will now be swapped.  To swap them back to their 
original configuration, simply run SWAPPRNT.BAS again.
