This is [...] a series of fractal artworks that I ported from Ultra Fractal to Quick Basic 4.5 with the Future library, and are currently upgrading to QB64. I received permission from the author(s) of the artworks to republish their works in this particular form. The original consists of a lot of include and routine files $included in the main, which I have merged here for convenience.
