It takes clever programming indeed to create an 
interesting one-line program. You'll be amazed at 
how much can be accomplished. 

DIE_ODDS.BAS simulates the results of tossing two dice, dropping "rocks" in  
ever-growing piles to illustrate the outcome visually. If you toss two dice,  
the odds are greatest that you'll throw a total of seven; a sum of 2 or 12 is  
the least likely to turn up. In the program's on-screen display, the left  
column indicates the number of times the value of a roll will equal 2, the  
next column shows the number of times it will equal 3, and so on. Piles of  
equal color represent totals with the same odds.
