'  Runs CHKDSK if it has not been run during the current month

==============================================================================

---------
 CHK.BAS
---------
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
The version of QBasic that comes with DOS 5 or later, or Microsoft Quick Basic 
4.x.

WHAT CHK.BAS DOES:
When CHK.BAS is run, it in turn runs DOS's CHKDSK program, but only if CHKDSK 
has not already been run by CHK.BAS during the current month.  CHKDSK is a DOS 
program that you should run periodically to check the status of your hard 
drive.  CHK.BAS helps you automate this task.

USING CHK.BAS:
When CHK.BAS is run, it examines a file called DATE.OLD, which contains the 
date on which CHK.BAS was last run.  CHK.BAS creates DATE.OLD the first time 
you run it, then updates DATE.OLD with the current date each time it runs.  If 
CHK.BAS determines that the month has changed since it last ran, the program 
then runs DOS's CHKDSK program, adding the output of CHKDSK to a file called 
DISK.DAT.  Then CHK.BAS displays the contents of DISK.DAT so you can see if 
any problems were found when CHKDSK checked your hard drive.

If CHK.BAS finds that the month has NOT changed since it last ran, nothing is 
displayed, although you will see the screen flash briefly as QBasic processes 
CHK.BAS.

The best way to use CHK.BAS is to insert it into your AUTOEXEC.BAT file so it 
will run automatically each time your computer is turned on or restarted.  
Assuming that CHK.BAS is stored on your hard drive in the C:\DRGSL1 directory, 
add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

QBASIC /RUN C:\DRGSL1\CHK.BAS

If you have stored CHK.BAS in another directory, you must change the line 
above to refer to the directory where CHK.BAS is actually located.

You can also load and run CHK.BAS manually.  To load the program, type QBASIC 
CHK.BAS (using path names if necessary) at the DOS prompt. Then run the 
program by selecting the Start option in QBasic's Run menu, or press Shift-F5.
