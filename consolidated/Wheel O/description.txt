It takes clever programming indeed to create an 
interesting one-line program. You'll be amazed at 
how much can be accomplished. 

WHEEL_O.BAS lets you try your luck at a wheel of fortune. The program starts  
you out with $1000 and prompts you for the amount you want to bet and the  
number between zero and nine that you think will come up. When you're right,  
your win is added to the pot; if you're wrong, the loss is subtracted. The  
nicest thing about this game, though, is that losing doesn't cost you  
anything.
