It takes clever programming indeed to create an 
interesting one-line program. You'll be amazed at 
how much can be accomplished. 

SLOT.BAS starts you with $1000; when you press any key to enter a $10 bet,  
the slot machine's three digits spin. When the leftmost and center slots  
match, the payoff is seven times the matching number. As with "real" one- 
armed bandits, you win big when all three numbers match: 10 times the square  
of the matching number, to be exact.
