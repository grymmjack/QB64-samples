# What are these?

These are [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) ([GWBASIC](https://winworldpc.com/product/gw-basic/3x), [QBasic](https://winworldpc.com/product/qbasic/1x), [QuickBASIC](https://winworldpc.com/product/quickbasic/45), [Microsoft BASIC PDS](https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-basic/pds-71), [Microsoft Visual Basic 1.0 for DOS](https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-visual-bas/10-for-dos)) programs tested and fixed for [QB64](https://github.com/QB64-Phoenix-Edition/QB64pe).

1. Some of the "unknown" are placeholders and I will update with the correct information once I find them
2. Some of these are mildly or significantly modified to work with QB64 v2+ and may no longer work with anything else
3. Some of these are unmodified as they were written for QB64 and are here just as part of the collection
4. If you want the original versions, then folllow the links below or search on the internet
5. I will keep updating this repo with new stuff that I can find and fix to work with QB64
